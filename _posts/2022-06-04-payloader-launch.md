Maiden flight of the RocketryWorks Payloader rocket on an AeroTech G80-7T composite motor. The rocket is the B-80 (66mm) body, payload bay, rounded ogive nosecone, and the 29mm motor mount. To be honest, this flight was way overpowered for this rocket, this rocket and motor combo should not be flown without a Jolly Logic ChuteRelease. I initially planned for this rocket to be used for a level 1 NAR (National Association of Rocketry) certification for high power rocketry, but this flight dashed that plan due to how well the rocket performed, even with the weight of a reusable baffle. This rocket is just too light for high power, it can be done but expect to lose your rocket or put a tracker in it! 

That being said, this flight was a complete success and the payloader was gone in a blink of an eye but made it safely back to the ground in one piece after a long and hard maiden flight. Minimal damage was done to the launch lugs due to how far apart they are on the rocket. The lugs may need to be put closer together or glued with stronger adhesive.
