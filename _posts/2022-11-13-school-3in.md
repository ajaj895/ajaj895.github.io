Maiden flight of the Balsa Machining Service (BMS) 3-Inch School Rocket on an AeroTech F23-4FJ/L. This School Rocket is equiped with the 34-inch tube length, rail buttons, a baffle, and a 29mm motor mount. Opposite to my previous midpower flight, this motor was not powerful enough for this rocket. It did not quite leave the launch rod with enough speed for the fins and pitched over slightly before the fins had enough airflow. Due to the heft of the rocket, the ejection charge was not short enough either. The rocket was pitching straight down when the charge fired, this caused more stress on the airframe that caused minor zipping on the airframe that can be repaired. This rocket was a learning experience and I plan to use this rocket for my L1 cert after I do minor repairs on the zip. Building the loadable motors was also a plus in the building phase and for financial reasons. 

Again, being said, I consider this flight a success because the rocket sustained minimal damage and could be flown again.
